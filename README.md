# playWithFields_miniApp
 This mini project was built to master further features of JavaScript including the creation of a new element within its parent element then removing it by typing its name 
 in the remove class field . Those two fields (the add class input and the remove class input) can accept any type of value( single or composite, uppercase or lowercase 
 values) and display it after the blur event is applied. 
 The first input will split the value in case it is composite and display it separetely . The same applies for the remove class input as you can type as much words as
 you want and delete them in one click outside the input if they already exist in the current element box.
